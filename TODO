* gscan for discrete-time: it's not exactly scanr, because we want to allow the "scanning function" to be able
   to control the Time in the resulting pairs?

* on other hand if we don't pass dt to scanning func in continuous vs. non-discrete case, we can't calculate
   integration (also because the initial result has to take the -infty time or something)
