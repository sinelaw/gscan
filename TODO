* gscan for discrete-time: it's not exactly scanr, because we want to allow the "scanning function" to be able
   to control the Time in the resulting pairs?

* on other hand if we don't pass dt to scanning func in continuous vs. non-discrete case, we can't calculate
   integration (also because the initial result has to take the -infty time or something)

* define time shifting without allowing setting of values at aribtrary times

* make 4  example illustrative graphs, one for each class of temporal values.

* section 3.3 Continuous time, non-discrete value
  - maybe no need to mention bndlimited signals at all in this sectino?
  - used to show that as dt -> 0, succesive values in the sequence -> identical

* test cases solution for discrete-time case

* "Consequently, a better type for scanlT is.." - explain why the change frpm TP b to b in the function arg

* better notation for the u_n sequence

* impulses / dirac's delta - discuss

* integration - no need for +y1/2? we can just use y2*dt?
